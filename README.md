This repository contains materials, code, and papers for Phase 1 of the [DSLab](https://bkai.ai/research/machine-learning/) training program, part of the [International Center BKAI](https://bkai.ai).

Phase 1 training focuses on the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a practical emphasis on NLP. You can start practicing right away using the Google Colab badge above.

## Directories

- `materials`: Contains all lectures from the [Machine Learning](https://bkai.ai/course/machine-learning-and-data-mining/) IT3190E course at HUST, taught by [Assoc. Prof. Than Quang Khoat](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/), Team Leader of DSLab.

- `ss1`: Season 1 focuses on preprocessing text documents with TF-IDF and Ridge Regression.

- `ss2`: Season 2 focuses on K-Means and SVM.

- `ss3`: Season 3 focuses on ANN.

- `ss4`: Season 4 focuses on time-series data, specifically RNNs.

Each season includes:

- `ss/data`: Stores raw and processed data for training.

- `ss/materials`: Contains research papers.

- `ss/src`: Source code.

## Note

I am currently in Phase 2 of the DSLab training, which focuses on Probabilistic Graph Models and requires a substantial amount of mathematics, particularly in Probability and Statistics. I will occasionally update this repository with relevant content. If you are interested, I recommend the [CS228](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228/) course on Probabilistic Graphical Models from Stanford.

If you are reading this `README.md`, you may be interested in joining DSLab. Application forms open in August each year on [BKAI's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bk.ai.ResearchCenter). The application process includes a 2-month waiting period for CV review, with announcements made in late September for successful applicants. The first interview takes place at the beginning of October, followed by a 3-month period of self-study in mathematics before the second interview. The entire process to become an official member of DSLab takes approximately 6 months.

Don't worry if you're not confident in your math skills; I wasn't either, but I still made it. Good luck, and I hope to see you soon at DSLab!
